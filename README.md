lump sum vs. dollar cost averaging.

I wasn't sure if ["Lump-sum investing outperforms dollar cost averaging almost 75% of the time"](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing/#:~:text=Lump%2Dsum%20investing%20outperforms%20dollar%20cost%20averaging%20almost%2075%25%20of,sum%20could%20yield%20better%20results.) is actually true. So I ran a small script. 

Check out [`investment.ipynb`](./investment.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

1. A unix or unix-like x86 machine
1. python 3.8 or higher.
1. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up with the system python.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## TODOs

1. Try other ticker symbols.
2. Try cryptos.
3. Come up with a better inflation rate, based on the investment starting date.
